executive summary electric vehicle ev adoption has increased significantly over the past ten years. current projections suggest that by 2030, almost thirty percent of vehicles travelling on north american roads will be electric.1 as the electric vehicle market expands, providing ev charging will become an economic and environmental imperative. installing ev charging infrastructure can provide a value added amenity with which to attract new tenants, increase the retention rate of existing tenants, and increase current tenant satisfaction. ev charging infrastructure can also provide an eventual new revenue stream. 2 table of contents industry overview procurement 2. current state of the electric vehicle market 8. charging infrastructure basics  roadmap for the future 10. site

course of the last decade, and the increased demand for evs has brought this technology to the immediate future.5 forefront of conversations about climate change and sustainable development. in the united states, the transportation sector is the second largest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 29 of the national totals.2 as the federal and state governments have responded to the need to reduce emissions and transition to a more sustainable mode of transportation, stimulus packages including incentives, rebates, and grantshave been made available to both commercial developers and residential consumers interested in exploring ev charging technology. ev sales have been growing at a consistent rate of 50 per year since 2010, and current projections suggest that there will be over one million electric vehicles travelling on north american roads by 2024.3 this figure suggests that in short order, offering ev charging in commercial real estate settings will become a requisite element for property owners and managers as tenants, employees, and consumers begin to factor their ability to charge into their decisions about where they work and shop. electric vehicles are both a more sustainable mode of transportation and a much better value proposition than traditional gas-powered vehicles, with significantly reduced maintenance and fuel costs as compared to their predecessors.4 the refueling model for electric vehicles is vastly different from that of a gas- powered vehicle. whereas a traditional combustion vehicle can refuel in a few minutes at a gas station, evs must be connected to a charging station to replenish their battery. depending on the charging solution, most sessions tend to take anywhere from thirty minutes to more than twelve hours. 4 this marked distinction in the refueling methodology presents a unique set of as the number of electric vehicles increases across north america, so too will the opportunities for those individuals

electric vehicles in canada is approximately 6.7. more charging infrastructure is necessary to satisfy the growing demand!6 5 impact of deploying ev charging infrastructure sustainability benefits of deploying ev charging infrastructure there is a wide variety of environmental benefits consistent with deploying ev charging infrastructure in a commercial real estate setting. due to the disparate nature of their charging infrastructure requirements, efforts have been made to distinguish office  light industrial buildings workplaces from commercially oriented sites such as shopping malls and entertainment centres retail. workplaces for workplaces, installing charging infrastructure offers a multitude of sustain- ability benefits. as more and more federal, provincial, and state legislative bodies work towards mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reduction for businesses, electric vehicle charging infrastructure could become an unavoidable investment for those looking to meet the requirements of these new regulations. an analysis of workplace charging sites revealed an average gross greenhouse gas emission reduction of up to 9,750 kilograms per year. that is equivalent to planting 445 trees!7 perhaps the most significant impact of deploying electric vehicle infrastructure in a workplace setting is the direct effect this process has on ev adoption. beyond simply offering individuals the ability to charge at work, installing ev charging infrastructure will allow those individuals considering electric vehicles to see their peers utilizing ev technology on a daily basis, and this may work to dispel any anx- ieties about transitioning to an ev themselves. research shows individuals are up to six times more likely to transition to an electric vehicle if their place of work offers the opportunity to chargeand while this correlation between charging infrastructure and an increased propensity for ev adoption is not unique to the workplace segment, it does afford many business segments the opportunity to participate directly in efforts to increase sustainability in the transit sector.8 6 cadillac fairview has one of the most comprehen- retail sive

as such will value different benefits associated with electric vehicle charging. the property owner of retail site would most likely seek to install ev charging as a value-added amenity for tenants of the building, and in doing so could help to provide those tenants with the resources necessary to allow their businesses to flourish economically by attracting desirable consumers and keeping them onsite for an extended period of time. an analysis of charging events at commercial and open-air retail sites revealed an average session time of over two hours.12 establishing a consumer profile for electric vehicle owners is key to understanding why retail sites would benefit from an investment in charging infrastructure. ev drivers make for desirable consumers; according to a survey conducted by the california center for sustainable energy, 43 of ev owners have an annual house- hold income of 100k199,000, and a further 18 exceed that and fall into the 200k299,999 range.13 this is a significant benefit of procuring ev charging infrastructure, as these individuals will be attracted to sites that offer them the opportunity to charge their vehicle, and fully charging an ev usually requires upwards of thirty minutes on a leading north american network, the average charging session duration at retail establishments is over two hours. the com- bination of increased consumer traffic and an extended duration of stay can help drive business to the tenants of a retail site. 9 procurement charging infrastructure basics electric vehicles need to be charged regularly, and each ev is equipped with a battery management system bms that manages the transfer of energy required to charge the car battery. this process occurs in concert with the charging station, or electric vehicle supply equipment evse, which is the conduit and control device for managing the flow of electricity from the grid to the vehicle. currently, the types of charging stations can be broken down into three levels. level 1 charging station level 2 charging station the slowest of ev chargers, these operate at 120v and can be plugged directly into the most popular commercial charging option, level 2 charging stations are the existing electrical infrastructure of a building with little to no modifications; typically mounted on a pedestal, a wall or, in certain cases, deployed as a curb-

with the charging experience of a workplace or retail sites, these chargers operate between 220v and 240v and can provide a full retail site. they are often included with the sale of an electric vehicle. charge to a standard electric vehicle much faster than their level 1 counterparts approximately 6-8 hours, depending on the vehicle. 10 dc fast charging station by converting ac alternating current to dc direct current, dc fast charging dcfc stations can provide a full charge to most compatible electric vehicles for example, plug-in hybrids are not compatible with dc fast charging in as little as thirty 30 minutes. best suited for public and fleet deployments due to their requirement for fast turnover, dc fast chargers typically operate at power levels of 50kw or more. usage statistics demonstrate that most ev drivers prefer to charge their vehicle at home or at work, as that is where the vehicle is parked for a long enough period to gain a charge able to facilitate their commuting needs. level 1 charging stations often fail to meet both the necessary range-per-hour and durability considerations consistent with workplace and retail charging patterns; a level 2 charging eco- system is therefore recognized as the optimal solution for these environments. with significant incentive and rebate programs available, level 2 and even dcfc solutions are becoming increasingly affordable and should be considered a crucial investment for those commercial real estate settings eager to attract new tenants and to support compliance with regional environmental regulations. 11

presence of smart technology in todays corporate and retail environments, it should come as little surprise that ev charging stations are often made available in networked stations connected to a service and manage- ment network and non networked stations not connected to any such network capacities. networked charging stations often offer a full suite of benefits, such as remote firmware and software upgrades, proactive station monitoring, and advanced data and analytics options. these functionalities ensure that networked charging solutions feature a lower total cost of ownership than their non networked alternatives. while non-networked chargers represent a lower capital expense at the beginning of the procurement process, it should be noted that these stations are a poorer long-term value proposition compared to their networked counterparts, and their limitations are pronounced. networked charging stations can be combined with a services agreement to ensure optimization of a charging deployment, and choosing a solutions provider that is vertically integrated can ensure that both the hardware and software elements of the solution are operating in sync. selecting a provider that is responsible for both the hardware and software components of the charging solution will help prevent stranded assets by ensuring that charging stations remain operating, maintenance and repairs are done quickly and efficiently, and remote updates are made as needed. if scalability is a priority, network functionality is a critical component of keeping a charging deployment future friendly. for example, the data and analytics options consistent with a networked charging station will allow station owners to monitor crucial usage information such as energy transferred, station uptake, and monies earned from charging sessionsand could even help them understand when more stations are necessary to satiate the increasing demand for charging services. similarly, networked stations offer remote firmware and software upgrades, a crucial component to ensuring that charging stations remain compatible with the growing number of ev models offered by the automotive industry.

implement is the best practice for ensuring optimal use of their electric vehicle charging stations. this can be a project undertaken by human resources, a facilities manager, a sustainability director, or even a committee formed via approval from management. a clearly defined workplace charging policy should consider items such as: charging priority billing practices when deciding who will get to use the chargers and in what order, it makes the a common question pertaining to ev charging infrastructure for workplaces most sense to assign priority to those employees who are unable to

as fleet, it is imperative that these applications be kept separate. fleet charging stations should be kept separate from those of general use and should be clearly designated as such. as previously mentioned, properly demarcating parking spaces designated for charging, and clearly stating the penalty for blocking these spaces, will assist in preventing iceing the process whereby a combustion vehicle or a fully charged ev blocks an available charger. 22 best practices  retail billing practices billing modes for retail sites are somewhat less complicated than those for the workplaces. unless there is a particular imperative for offering free charging such as publicity or subsidized utility costs, most retail sites will charge visitors for the use of charging stations. in these scenarios, a fixed fee attached for the cost of the total session or an hourly fee for continued use are the most common billing solutions. choosing a solutions provider that offers flexible billing and can facilitate a variety of modes based on specific requirements will help ensure that the charging stations are being utilized in the most efficient manner possible, while helping to recoup the costs of installing the charging stations. ev etiquette at a retail site in conjunction with effective signage, enforcing proper charging station etiquette at a retail site will help reduce frustration among ev drivers who frequent the location. some site owners and organizations choose to employ a parking attendant or security officer who can enforce site rules and regulations regarding ev charging; however, this is not a viable solution for all sites. clearly communi- cating potential penalties including administrative tickets and towing and instituting billing models that prevent overstay such as charging an increased fee per hour after the first four hours have also proven to be effective deterrents for iceing at retail sites. 23 conclusion the continued integration of electric vehicles into the transportation and auto- motive industries is an inevitable facet of the future. with electric vehicle charging technology currently in its infancy, those commercial real estate developers, site owners, and workplaces that embrace this exciting new technology could better position themselves for the inevitable rise in demand for charging services. we hope that this guide can provide an introduction to the technology and benefits associated with ev charging and offer instructions on how to engage in a thorough and vendor-agnostic procurement process for electric vehicle charging infrastructure. 24 citations 1. global ev outlook 2017, the international energy agency iea, retrieved 9. environmental defense fund, californias zero-emission cars study, may 2021,

or electric vehicle supply equipment evse, is a power supply device that supplies electrical power for recharging plug-in electric vehicles including battery electric vehicles, electric trucks, electric buses, neighborhood electric vehicles, and plug-in hybrid vehicles. there are two main types of ev chargers: alternating current ac charging stations and direct current dc charging stations. electric vehicle batteries can only be charged by direct current electricity, while most mains electricity is delivered from the power grid as alternating current. for this reason, most electric vehicles have a built-in ac-to-dc converter commonly known as the onboard charger obc. at an ac charging station, ac power from the grid is supplied to this onboard charger, which converts it into dc power to recharge the battery. dc chargers provide higher power charging which requires much larger ac-to-dc converters by building the converter into the charging station instead of the vehicle to avoid size and weight restrictions. the station then directly supplies dc power to the vehicle, bypassing the onboard converter. most modern electric car models can accept both ac and dc power. charging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of international standards. dc charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to charge various vehicles that use competing standards. public charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. private charging stations are usually found at residences, workplaces, and hotels. multiple standards have been established for charging technology to enable interoperability across vendors. standards are available for nomenclature, power, and connectors. tesla developed proprietary technology in these areas and began building its charging networking in 2012.1 in 2011, the european automobile manufacturers association acea defined the following terms:2 the terms electric vehicle connector and electric vehicle inlet were previously defined in the same way under article 625 of the united states national electrical code nec of 1999. nec-1999 also defined the term electric vehicle supply equipment as the entire unit installed specifically for the purpose of delivering energy from the premises wiring to the electric vehicle, including conductors ... electric vehicle connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power outlets, or apparatuses.3 tesla, inc. uses the term charging station as the location of a group of chargers, and the term connector for an individual evse.4 the national electric transportation infrastructure working council iwc was formed in 1991 by the electric power research institute with members drawn from automotive manufacturers and the electric utilities to define standards in the united states;6 early work by the iwc led to the definition of three levels of charging in the 1999 national electrical code nec handbook.5: 9 under the 1999 nec, level 1 charging equipment as defined in the nec handbook but not in the code was connected to the grid through a standard nema 5-20r 3-prong electrical outlet with grounding, and a ground-fault circuit interrupter was required within 12 in 30 cm of the plug. the supply circuit required protection at 125 of the maximum rated current; for example, charging equipment rated at 16 amperes amps or a continuous current required a breaker sized to 20 a.5: 9 level 2 charging equipment as defined in the handbook was permanently wired and fastened at a fixed location under nec-1999. it also required grounding and ground-fault protection; in addition, it required an interlock to prevent vehicle startup during charging and a safety breakaway for the cable and connector. a 40 a breaker 125 of continuous maximum supply current was required to protect the branch circuit.5: 9 for convenience and speedier charging, many early evs preferred that owners and operators install level 2 charging equipment, which was connected to the ev either through an inductive paddle magne charge or a conductive connector avcon.5: 1011, 18 level 3 charging equipment used an off-vehicle rectifier to convert the input ac power to dc, which was then supplied to the vehicle. at the time it was written, the 1999 nec handbook anticipated that level 3 charging equipment would require utilities to upgrade their distribution systems and transformers.5: 9 the society of automotive engineers sae international defines the general physical, electrical, communication, and performance requirements for ev charging systems used in north america, as part of standard sae j1772, initially developed in 2001.8 sae j1772 defines four levels of charging, two levels each for ac and dc supplies; the differences between levels are based upon the power distribution type, standards and maximum power. ac charging stations connect the vehicles onboard charging circuitry directly to the ac supply.8 commonly, though incorrectly, called level 3 charging based on the older nec-1999 definition, dc charging is categorized separately in the sae standard. in dc fast-charging, grid ac power is passed through an ac-to-dc converter in the station before reaching the vehicles battery, bypassing any ac-to-dc converter on board the vehicle.89 additional standards released by sae for charging include sae j3068 three-phase ac charging, using the type 2 connector defined in iec 62196-2 and sae j3105 automated connection of dc charging devices. in 2003, the international electrotechnical commission iec adopted a majority of the sae j1772 standard under iec 62196-1 for international implementation. the iec alternatively defines charging in modes iec 61851-1: the connection between the electric grid and charger electric vehicle supply equipment is defined by three cases iec 61851-1: the north american charging system nacs was developed by tesla, inc. for use in the companys vehicles. it remained a proprietary standard until 2022 when its specifications were published by tesla.1314 the connector is physically smaller than the j1772ccs connector, and uses the same pins for both ac and dc charging functionality. as of november 2023, automakers ford, general motors, rivian, volvo, polestar, mercedes-benz, nissan, honda, jaguar, fisker, hyundai, bmw, toyota, subaru, and lucid motors have all committed to equipping their north american vehicles with nacs connectors in the future.151617 automotive startup aptera motors has also adopted the connector standard in its vehicles.18 other automakers, such as stellantis and volkswagen have not made an announcement.19 to meet european union eu requirements on recharging points,20 tesla vehicles sold in the eu are equipped with a ccs combo 2 port. both the north america and the eu port take 480 v dc fast charging through teslas network of superchargers, which variously use nacs and ccs charging connectors. depending on the supercharger version, power is supplied at 72, 150, or 250 kw, the first corresponding to dc level 1 and the second and third corresponding to dc level 2 of sae j1772. as of q4 2021, tesla reported 3,476 supercharging locations worldwide and 31,498 supercharging chargers about 9 chargers per location on average.4 an extension to the ccs dc fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks is under development, which will provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles class 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well, including school and transit buses. when the charging interface initiative e. v. charin task force was formed in march 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called high power charging hpc for commercial vehicles hpccv,21 later renamed megawatt charging system mcs. mcs is expected to operate in the range of 2001500 v and 03000 a for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5 megawatts mw. the proposal calls for mcs charge ports to be compatible with existing ccs and hpc chargers.22 the task force released aggregated requirements in february 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000 v dc optionally, 1500 v dc and 3000 a continuous rating.23 a connector design was selected in may 201921 and tested at the national renewable energy laboratory nrel in september 2020. thirteen manufacturers participated in the test, which checked the coupling and thermal performance of seven vehicle inlets and eleven charger connectors.24 the final connector requirements and specification was adopted in december 2021 as mcs connector version 3.2.2526: 3 with support from portland general electric, on 21 april 2021 daimler trucks north america opened the electric island, the first heavy-duty vehicle charging station, across the street from its headquarters in portland, oregon. the station is capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously, and the charging bays are sized to accommodate tractor-trailers. in addition, the design is capable of accommodating 1 mw chargers once they are available.27 a startup company, wattev, announced plans in may 2021 to build a 40-stall truck stopcharging station in bakersfield, california. at full capacity, it would provide a combined 25 mw of charging power, partially drawn from an on-site solar array and battery storage.28 common connectors include type 1 yazaki, type 2 mennekes, ccs combo 1 and 2, chademo, and tesla.293031 many standard plug types are defined in iec 62196-2 for ac supplied power and 62196-3 for dc supplied power: quick notes on ev charger types ccs dc charging requires power-line communication plc. two connectors are added at the bottom of type 1 or type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to supply dc current. these are commonly known as combo 1 or combo 2 connectors. the choice of style inlets is normally standardized on a per-country basis so that public chargers do not need to fit cables with both variants. generally, north america uses combo 1 style vehicle inlets, while most of the rest of the world uses combo 2. the chademo standard is favored by nissan, mitsubishi, and toyota, while the sae j1772 combo standard is backed by gm, ford, volkswagen, bmw, and hyundai. both systems charge to 80 in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. richard martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm navigant research, stated: the broader conflict between the chademo and sae combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out.34 in the united states, many of the evs first marketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as the gm ev1, ford ranger ev, and chevrolet s-10 ev preferred the use of level 2 single-phase ac evse, as defined under nec-1999, to maintain acceptable charging speed. these evses were fitted with either an inductive connector magne charge or a conductive connector generally avcon. proponents of the inductive system were gm, nissan, and toyota; daimlerchrysler, ford, and honda backed the conductive system.5: 1011 magne charge paddles were available in two different sizes: an older, larger paddle used for the ev1 and s-10 ev and a newer, smaller paddle used for the first-generation toyota rav4 ev, but backwards compatible with large-paddle vehicles through an adapter.35 the larger paddle introduced in 1994 was required to accommodate a liquid-cooled vehicle inlet charge port; the smaller paddle introduced in 2000 interfaced with an air-cooled inlet instead.3637: 23 sae j1773, which described the technical requirements for inductive paddle coupling, was first issued in january 1995, with another revision issued in november 1999.37: 26 the influential california air resources board adopted the conductive connector as its standard on 28 june 2001, based on lower costs and durability,38 and the magne charge paddle was discontinued by the following march.39 three conductive connectors existed at the time, named according to their manufacturers: avcon aka butt-and-pin, used by ford, solectria, and honda; yazaki aka pin-and-sleeve, on the rav4 ev; and odu used by daimlerchrysler.37: 22 the avcon butt-and-pin connector supported level 2 and level 3 dc charging and was described in the appendix of the first version 1996 of the sae j1772 recommended practice; the 2001 version moved the connector description into the body of the practice, making it the de facto standard for the united states.37: 25 40 iwc recommended the avcon butt connector for north america,37: 22 based on environmental and durability testing.41 as implemented, the avcon connector used four contacts for level 2 l1, l2, pilot, ground and added five more three for serial communications, and two for dc power for level 3 l1, l2, pilot, com1, com2, ground, clean data ground, dc, dc.42 by 2009, j1772 had instead adopted the round pin-and-sleeve yazaki connector as its standard implementation, and the rectangular avcon butt connector was rendered obsolete.43 charging time depends on the batterys capacity, power density, and charging power.44 the larger the capacity, the more charge the battery can hold analogous to the size of a fuel tank. higher power density allows the battery to accept more charge per unit time the size of the tank opening. higher charging power supplies more energy per unit time analogous to a pumps flow rate. an important downside of charging at fast speeds is that it also adds stress to the mains electricity grid.45 the california air resources board specified a target minimum range of 150 miles 240 km to qualify as a zero-emission vehicle, and further specified that the vehicle should allow for fast-charging.46 charge time can be calculated as:47 charging time h  battery capacity kwh charging power kw displaystyle textcharging time hfrac textbattery capacity kwhtextcharging power kw the effective charging power can be lower than the maximum charging power due to limitations of the battery or battery management system, charging losses which can be as high as 2548, and vary over time due to charging limits applied by a charge controller. the usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original nissan leaf, was about 20 kilowatt-hours kwh, giving it a range of about 100 mi 160 km.citation needed tesla was the first company to introduce longer-range vehicles, initially releasing their model s with battery capacities of 40 kwh, 60 kwh and 85 kwh, with the latter lasting for about 480 km 300 mi.49 as of 2022update plug-in hybrid vehicles typically had an electric range of 15 to 60 miles 2497 km.50 batteries are charged with dc power. to charge from the ac power supplied by the electrical grid, evs have a small ac-to-dc converter built into the vehicle. the charging cable supplies ac power directly from the grid, and the vehicle converts this power to dc internally and charges its battery. the built-in converters on most evs typically support charging speeds up to 67 kw, sufficient for overnight charging.51 this is known as ac charging. to facilitate rapid recharging of evs, much higher power 50100 kw is necessary.citation needed this requires a much larger ac-to-dc converter which is not practical to integrate into the vehicle. instead, the ac-to-dc conversion is performed by the charging station, and dc power is supplied to the vehicle directly, bypassing the built-in converter. this is known as dc fast charging. charging stations are usually accessible to multiple electric vehicles and are equipped with current or connection sensing mechanisms to disconnect the power when the ev is not charging. the two main types of safety sensors: sensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail, and are possibly less expensive to design and implement.citation needed current sensors however can use standard connectors and can allow suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed. longer drives require a network of public charging stations. in addition, they are essential for vehicles that lack access to a home charging station, as is common in multi-family housing. costs vary greatly by country, power supplier, and power source. some services charge by the minute, while others charge by the amount of energy received measured in kilowatt-hours. in the united states, some states have banned the use of charging by kwh.53 charging stations may not need much new infrastructure in developed countries, less than delivering a new fuel over a new network.54 the stations can leverage the existing ubiquitous electrical grid.55 charging stations are offered by public authorities, commercial enterprises, and some major employers to address a range of barriers. options include simple charging posts for roadside use, charging cabinets for covered parking places, and fully automated charging stations integrated with power distribution equipment.56 as of december 2012update, around 50,000 non-residential charging points were deployed in the u.s., europe, japan and china.57 as of august 2014update, some 3,869 chademo quick chargers were deployed, with 1,978 in japan, 1,181 in europe and 686 in the united states, and 24 in other countries.58 as of december 2021 the total number of public and private ev charging stations was over 57,000 in the united states and canada combined.59 as of may 2023, there are over 3.9 million public ev charging points worldwide, with europe having over 600,000, china leading with over 2.7 million.60 united states has over 138,100 charging outlets for plug-in electric vehicles evs. in january 2023, sp global mobility estimated that the us has about 126,500 level 2 and 20,431 level 3 charging stations, plus another 16,822 tesla superchargers and tesla destination chargers.61 as of december 2012update, japan had 1,381 public dc fast-charging stations, the largest deployment of fast chargers in the world, but only around 300 ac chargers.57 as of december 2012update, china had around 800 public slow charging points, and no fast charging stations.57 as of september 2013update, the largest public charging networks in australia were in the capital cities of perth and melbourne, with around 30 stations 7 kw ac established in both cities  smaller networks exist in other capital cities.62 in india, public electric vehicle ev charging stations are commonly located street-side and at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. private charging stations are typically found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.citation needed as of december 2013, estonia was the only country that had completed the deployment of an ev charging network with nationwide coverage, with 165 fast chargers available along highways at a maximum distance of between 4060 km 2537 mi, and a higher density in urban areas.636465 as of november 2012, about 15,000 charging stations had been installed in europe.66 as of march 2013, norway had 4,029 charging points and 127 dc fast-charging stations.67 as part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 fast dc charging stations across the country by 2015. the rollout will be undertaken by abb and dutch startup fastned, aiming to provide at least one station every 50 km 31 mi for the netherlands 16 million residents.68 in addition to that, the e-laad foundation installed about 3000 public slow charge points since 2009.69 compared to other markets, such as china, the european electric car market has developed slowly. this, together with the lack of charging stations, has reduced the number of electric models available in europe.70 in 2018 and 2019 the european investment bank eib signed several projects with companies like allego, greenway, becharge and enel x. the eib loans will support the deployment of the charging station infrastructure with a total of 200 million.70 the uk government declared that it will ban the selling of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 for a complete shift towards electric charging vehicles.71 as of february 2025, there are 84,191 charging stations, including the level 1, level 2 and dc fast charging stations, across the united states and canada.72 as of october 2023, in the u.s. and canada, there are 6,502 stations with chademo connectors, 7,480 stations with sae ccs1 connectors, and 7,171 stations with tesla north american charging system nacs connectors, according to the u.s. department of energys alternative fuels data center.72 as of august 2018update, 800,000 electric vehicles and 18,000 charging stations operated in the united states,73 up from 5,678 public charging stations and 16,256 public charging points in 2013.7475 by july 2020, tesla had installed 1,971 stations 17,467 plugs.76 colder areas in northern us states and canada have some infrastructure for public power receptacles provided primarily for use by block heaters. although their circuit breakers prevent large current draws for other uses, they can be used to recharge electric vehicles, albeit slowly.77 in public lots, some such outlets are turned on only when the temperature falls below 20 c, further limiting their value.78 as of late 2023, a limited number of tesla superchargers are starting to open to non-tesla vehicles through the use of a built in ccs adapter for existing superchargers.79 other charging networks are available for all electric vehicles. networks like electrify america, evgo, chargefinder and chargepoint are popular among consumers. electrify america currently has 15 agreements with various automakers for their electric vehicles to use its network of chargers or provide discounted charging rates or complimentary charging, including audi, bmw, ford, hyundai, kia, lucid motors, mercedes, volkswagen, and more. prices are generally based on local rates and other networks may accept cash or a credit card. in june 2022, united states president biden announced a plan for a standardized nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 that will be agnostic to ev brands, charging companies, or location, in the united states.80 the us will provide us5 billion between 2022 and 2026 to states through the national electric vehicle infrastructure nevi formula program to build charging stations along major highways and corridors.81 one such proposed corridor called greenlane plans to establish charging infrastructure between los angeles, california and las vegas, nevada.82 however, by december 2023, no charging stations had been built.83 south african based electrosa and automobile manufacturers including bmw, nissan and jaguar have so far been able to install 80 electric car chargers nationwide.84 in april 2017 ypf, the state-owned oil company of argentina, reported that it will install 220 fast-load stations for electric vehicles in 110 of its service stations in the national territory.85 electric car manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and regional governments have entered into agreements and ventures to promote and provide electric vehicle networks of public charging stations. the ev plug alliance86 is an association of 21 european manufacturers that proposed an iec norm and a european standard for sockets and plugs. members schneider electric, legrand, scame, nexans, etc. claimed that the system was safer because they use shutters. prior consensus was that the iec 62196 and iec 61851-1 standards have already established safety by making parts non-live when touchable.878889 over 80 of electric vehicle charging is done at home, usually in a garage.90 in north america, level 1 charging is connected to a standard 120 volt outlet and provides less than 5 miles 8.0 km of range per hour of charging. to address the need for faster charging, level 2 charging stations have become more prevalent. these stations operate at 240 volts and can significantly increase the charging speed, delivering up to more than 30 miles 48 km of range per hour. level 2 chargers offer a more practical solution for ev owners, especially for those who have higher daily mileage requirements. charging stations can be installed using two main methods: hardwired connections to the main electrical panel box or through a cord and plug connected to a 240-volt receptacle. a popular choice for the latter is the nema 14-50 receptacle. this type of outlet provides 240 volts and, when wired to a 50-ampere circuit, can support charging at 40 amperes according to north american electrical code. this translates to a power supply of up to 9.6 kilowatts,91 offering a faster and more efficient charging experience. a battery swapping or switching station allow vehicles to exchange a discharged battery pack for a charged one, eliminating the charge interval. battery swapping is common in electric forklift applications.92 the concept of an exchangeable battery service was proposed as early as 1896. it was first offered between 1910 and 1924, by hartford electric light company, through the geveco battery service, serving electric trucks. the vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from general vehicle company geveco, part-owned by general electric.93 the power was purchased from hartford electric in the form of an exchangeable battery. both vehicles and batteries were designed to facilitate a fast exchange. the owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover truck maintenance and storage. these vehicles covered more than 6 million miles 9.7 million kilometres. beginning in 1917, a similar service operated in chicago for owners of milburn electric cars.94 91 years later, a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to service 50 electric buses at the 2008 summer olympics.95 better place, tesla, and mitsubishi heavy industries considered battery switch approaches.9697 one complicating factor was that the approach requires vehicle design modifications. in 2012, tesla started building a proprietary fast-charging tesla supercharger network.1 in 2013, tesla announced it would also support battery pack swaps.98 a demonstration swapping station was built at harris ranch and operated for a short period of time. however customers vastly preferred using the superchargers, so the swapping program was shut down.99 the following benefits were claimed for battery swapping: the better place network was the first modern attempt at the battery switching model. the renault fluence z.e. was the first car enabled to adopt the approach and was offered in israel and denmark.105 better place launched its first battery-swapping station in israel, in kiryat ekron, near rehovot in march 2011. the exchange process took five minutes.100106 better place filed for bankruptcy in israel in may 2013.107108 in june 2013, tesla announced its plan to offer battery swapping. tesla showed that a battery swap with the model s took just over 90 seconds.101109 elon musk said the service would be offered at around us60 to us80 at june 2013 prices. the vehicle purchase included one battery pack. after a swap, the owner could later return and receive their battery pack fully charged. a second option would be to keep the swapped battery and receivepay the difference in value between the original and the replacement. pricing was not announced.101 in 2015 the company abandoned the idea for lack of customer interest.110 by 2022, chinese luxury carmaker nio had built more than 900 battery swap stations across china and europe,111 up from 131 in 2020.112 unlike filling stations, which need to be located near roads that tank trucks can enter conveniently, charging stations can theoretically be placed anywhere with access to electric power and adequate parking. private locations include residences, workplaces, and hotels.113 residences are by far the most common charging location.114 residential charging stations typically lack user authentication and separate metering, and may require a dedicated circuit.115 many vehicles being charged at residences simply use a cable that plugs into a standard household electrical outlet.116 these cables may be wall mounted.citation needed public stations have been sited along highways, in shopping centers, hotels, government facilities and at workplaces. some gas stations offer ev charging stations.117 some charging stations have been criticized as inaccessible, hard to find, out of order, and slow, thus slowing ev adoption.118 public charge stations may charge a fee or offer free service based on government or corporate promotions. charge rates vary from residential rates for electricity to many times higher. the premium is usually for the convenience of faster charging. vehicles can typically be charged without the owner present, allowing the owner to partake in other activities.119 sites include malls, freeway rest areas, transit stations, and government offices.120121 typically, ac type 1type 2 plugs are used. wireless charging uses inductive charging mats that charge without a wired connection and can be embedded in parking stalls or even on roadways. mobile charging involves another vehicle that brings the charge station to the electric vehicle; the power is supplied via a fuel generator typically gasoline or diesel, or a large battery. an offshore electricity recharging system named stillstrom, to be launched by danish shipping firm maersk supply service, will give ships access to renewable energy while at sea.122 connecting ships to electricity generated by offshore wind farms, stillstrom is designed to cut emissions from idling ships.122 a smart grid is a power grid that can adapt to changing conditions by limiting service or adjusting prices. some charging stations can communicate with the grid and activate charging when conditions are optimal, such as when prices are relatively low. some vehicles allow the operator to control recharging.123 vehicle-to-grid scenarios allow the vehicle battery to supply the grid during periods of peak demand. this requires communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle. sae international is developing related standards. these include sae j28471.124125 iso and iec are developing similar standards known as isoiec 15118, which also provide protocols for automatic payment. electric vehicles evs can be powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, biogas, and some low-impact hydroelectric sources. renewable energy sources are generally less expensive, cleaner, and more sustainable than non-renewable sources like coal, natural gas, and petroleum power.126 charging stations are powered by whatever the power grid runs on, which might include oil, coal, and natural gas. however, many companies have been making advancements towards clean energy for their charging stations. as of november 2023, electrify america has invested over 5 million to develop over 50 solar-powered electric vehicle ev charging stations in rural california, including areas like fresno county. these resilient level 2 l2 stations arent tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to ev charging via renewable resources. electrify americas solar glow 1 project, a 75-megawatt solar power initiative in san bernardino county, is expected to generate 225,000 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 20,000 homes.127128 teslas superchargers and destination chargers are mostly powered by solar energy. teslas superchargers have solar canopies with solar panels that generate energy to offset electricity use. some destination chargers have solar panels mounted on canopies or nearby rooftops to generate energy. as of 2023, teslas global network was 100 renewable, achieved through a combination of onsite resources and annual renewable matching. the e-move charging station is equipped with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76 kw of solar power.129 in 2012, urban green energy introduced the worlds first wind-powered electric vehicle charging station, the sanya skypump. the design features a 4 kw vertical-axis wind turbine paired with a ge wattstation.130 in 2021, nova innovation introduced the worlds first direct from tidal power ev charge station.131 along a section of the highway e20 in sweden, which connects stockholm, gothenburg and malm\\u00f6, a plate has been placed under the asphalt that interfaces with electric cars, recharging an electromagnetic coil receiver. this allows greater vehicle autonomy and reduces the size of the battery compartment. the technology is planned to be implemented along 3,000 km of swedish roads.132 swedens first electrified stretch of road, and the worlds first permanent one,133 connects the hallsberg and \\u00f6rebro area. the work is scheduled

to the immediate future.5 forefront of conversations about climate change and sustainable development. in the united states, the transportation sector is the second largest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 29 of the national totals.2 as the federal and state governments have responded to the need to reduce emissions and transition to a more sustainable mode of transportation, stimulus packages including incentives, rebates, and grantshave been made available to both commercial developers and residential consumers interested in exploring ev charging technology. ev sales have been growing at a consistent rate of 50 per year since 2010, and current projections suggest that there will be over one million electric vehicles travelling on north american roads by 2024.3 this figure suggests that in short order, offering ev charging in commercial real estate settings will become a requisite element for property owners and managers as tenants, employees, and consumers begin to factor their ability to charge into their decisions about where they work and shop. electric vehicles are both a more sustainable mode of transportation and a much better value proposition than traditional gas-powered vehicles, with significantly reduced maintenance and fuel costs as compared to their predecessors.4 the refueling model for electric vehicles is vastly different from that of a gas- powered vehicle. whereas a traditional combustion vehicle can refuel in a few minutes at a gas station, evs must be connected to a charging station to replenish their battery. depending on the charging solution, most sessions tend to take anywhere from thirty minutes to more than twelve hours. 4 this marked distinction in the refueling methodology presents a

more charging infrastructure is necessary to satisfy the growing demand!6 5 impact of deploying ev charging infrastructure sustainability benefits of deploying ev charging infrastructure there is a wide variety of environmental benefits consistent with deploying ev charging infrastructure in a commercial real estate setting. due to the disparate nature of their charging infrastructure requirements, efforts have been made to distinguish office  light industrial buildings workplaces from commercially oriented sites such as shopping malls and entertainment centres retail. workplaces for workplaces, installing charging infrastructure offers a multitude of sustain- ability benefits. as more and more federal, provincial, and state legislative bodies work towards mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reduction for businesses, electric vehicle charging infrastructure could become an unavoidable investment for those looking to meet the requirements of these new regulations. an analysis of workplace charging sites revealed an average gross greenhouse gas emission reduction of up to 9,750 kilograms per year. that is equivalent to planting 445 trees!7 perhaps the most significant impact of deploying electric vehicle infrastructure in a workplace setting is the direct effect this process has on ev adoption. beyond simply offering individuals the ability to charge at work, installing ev charging infrastructure will allow those individuals considering electric vehicles to see their peers utilizing ev technology on a daily basis, and this may work to dispel any anx- ieties about transitioning to an ev themselves. research shows individuals are up to six times more likely to transition to an electric vehicle if their place of work offers the opportunity to chargeand while this correlation between charging infrastructure and an increased propensity for ev adoption is not unique to the workplace segment, it does afford many business segments the opportunity to participate directly in efforts to increase sustainability in the transit sector.8 6 cadillac fairview has one of the most comprehen- retail sive sustainability programs in canadian

associated with electric vehicle charging. the property owner of retail site would most likely seek to install ev charging as a value-added amenity for tenants of the building, and in doing so could help to provide those tenants with the resources necessary to allow their businesses to flourish economically by attracting desirable consumers and keeping them onsite for an extended period of time. an analysis of charging events at commercial and open-air retail sites revealed an average session time of over two hours.12 establishing a consumer profile for electric vehicle owners is key to understanding why retail sites would benefit from an investment in charging infrastructure. ev drivers make for desirable consumers; according to a survey conducted by the california center for sustainable energy, 43 of ev owners have an annual house- hold income of 100k199,000, and a further 18 exceed that and fall into the 200k299,999 range.13 this is a significant benefit of procuring ev charging infrastructure, as these individuals will be attracted to sites that offer them the opportunity to charge their vehicle, and fully charging an ev usually requires upwards of thirty minutes on a leading north american network, the average charging session duration at retail establishments is over two hours. the com- bination of increased consumer traffic and an extended duration of stay can help drive business to the tenants of a retail site. 9 procurement charging infrastructure basics electric vehicles need to be charged regularly, and each ev is equipped with a battery management system bms that manages the transfer of energy required to charge the car battery. this process occurs in concert with the charging station, or electric vehicle supply equipment evse, which is the conduit and control device for managing the flow of electricity from the grid to the vehicle. currently, the types of charging stations can be broken down into three levels. level 1 charging station level 2 charging station the slowest of ev chargers, these operate at 120v and can be plugged directly into the most popular commercial charging option, level 2 charging stations are the existing electrical infrastructure of a building with little to no modifications; typically mounted on a pedestal, a wall or, in certain cases, deployed as a curb- however, these chargers are often too slow to be convenient and are not designed side charging option by cities and municipalities. often found in workplaces or at for the repetitive use consistent with the charging experience of a workplace or retail sites, these chargers operate between 220v and 240v and can provide a full retail site. they are often included with the sale of an electric vehicle. charge to a standard electric vehicle much faster than their level 1 counterparts approximately 6-8 hours, depending on the vehicle. 10 dc fast charging station by converting ac alternating current to dc direct current, dc fast charging dcfc stations can provide a full charge to most compatible electric vehicles for example, plug-in hybrids are not compatible with dc fast charging in as little as thirty 30 minutes. best suited for public and fleet deployments due to their requirement for fast turnover, dc fast chargers typically operate at power levels of 50kw or more. usage statistics demonstrate that most ev drivers prefer to charge their vehicle at home or at work, as that is where the vehicle is parked for a long enough period to gain a charge able to facilitate their commuting needs. level 1 charging stations often fail to meet both the necessary range-per-hour and durability considerations consistent with workplace and retail charging patterns; a level 2 charging eco- system is therefore recognized as the optimal solution for these environments. with significant incentive and rebate programs available, level 2 and even dcfc solutions are becoming increasingly affordable and should be considered a crucial investment for those commercial real estate settings eager to attract new tenants and to support compliance with regional environmental regulations. 11 site analysis  right sizing a proper site

networks, and to have a consolidated view of their vehicles charging history, improves the ev user experience. public site owners should consider solutions providers whose stations are interoperable with regional public charging network operators. this will also allow site owners and businesses to provide paid public access to charging stations when they are not being used by regular consumers to ensure that the site remains able to grow alongside the demand for charging or employees. for example, an employer could offer paid charging spots outside services, several factors should be taken into consideration when choosing a of business hours or liaise with a local car sharing organization to offer charging charging solutions provider, with the primary being the focus of the solutions services for an agreed upon price. provider itself. many providers of charging technology choose to prioritize either a 13 networked solutions given the increased presence of smart technology in todays corporate and retail environments, it should come as little surprise that ev charging stations are often made available in networked stations connected to a service and manage- ment network and non networked stations not connected to any such network capacities. networked charging stations often offer a full suite of benefits, such as remote firmware and software upgrades, proactive station monitoring, and advanced data and analytics options. these functionalities ensure that networked charging solutions feature a lower total cost of ownership than their non networked alternatives. while non-networked chargers represent a lower capital expense at the beginning of the procurement process, it should be noted that these stations are a poorer long-term value proposition compared to their networked counterparts, and their limitations are pronounced. networked charging stations can be combined with a services agreement to ensure optimization of a charging deployment, and choosing a solutions provider that is vertically integrated can ensure that both the hardware and software elements of the solution are operating in sync. selecting a provider that is responsible for both the hardware and software components of the charging solution will help prevent stranded assets by ensuring that charging stations remain operating, maintenance and repairs are done quickly and efficiently, and remote updates are made as needed. if scalability is a priority, network functionality is a critical component of keeping a charging deployment future friendly. for example, the data and analytics options consistent with a networked charging station will allow station owners to monitor crucial usage information such as energy transferred, station uptake, and monies earned from charging sessionsand could even help them understand when more stations are necessary to satiate the increasing demand for charging services. similarly, networked stations offer remote firmware and software upgrades, a crucial component to ensuring that charging stations remain compatible with the growing number of ev models offered by the automotive industry. 14 suggested right-sizing algorithm

the most effective ways to ensure that ev charging stations are utilised as ev chargers often overlap with traditional parking spaces, there can be properly at a workplace or retail site is signage. signage serves the dual purpose instances whereby individuals knowingly or unknowingly block access to the of informing ev drivers that they can find charging stations at the site and charger. as such, deploying signage that clearly identifies the space as educating them as to the rules regarding these stations. while many charging dedicated to ev charging is necessary to ensure access to

practices  workplaces onboarding  ev etiquette for workplaces, onboarding their employees and educating them as to the nuances of the charging policies they hope to implement is the best practice for ensuring optimal use of their electric vehicle charging stations. this can be a project undertaken by human resources, a facilities manager, a sustainability director, or even a committee formed via approval from management. a clearly defined workplace charging policy should consider items such as: charging priority billing practices when deciding who will get to use the chargers and in what order, it makes the a common question pertaining to ev charging infrastructure for workplaces most sense to assign priority to those employees who are unable to charge at revolves around the idea of

these applications be kept separate. fleet charging stations should be kept separate from those of general use and should be clearly designated as such. as previously mentioned, properly demarcating parking spaces designated for charging, and clearly stating the penalty for blocking these spaces, will assist in preventing iceing the process whereby a combustion vehicle or a fully charged ev blocks an available charger. 22 best practices  retail billing practices billing modes for retail sites are somewhat less complicated than those for the workplaces. unless there is a particular imperative for offering free charging such as publicity or subsidized utility costs, most retail sites will charge visitors for the use of charging stations. in these scenarios, a fixed fee attached for the cost of the total session or an hourly fee for continued use are the most common billing solutions. choosing a solutions provider that offers flexible billing and can facilitate a variety of modes based on specific requirements will help ensure that the charging stations are being utilized in the most efficient manner possible, while helping to recoup the costs of installing the charging stations. ev etiquette at a retail site in conjunction with effective signage, enforcing proper charging station etiquette at a retail site will help reduce frustration among ev drivers who frequent the location. some site owners and organizations choose to employ a parking attendant or security officer who can enforce site rules and regulations regarding ev charging; however, this is not a viable solution for all sites. clearly communi- cating potential penalties including administrative tickets and towing and instituting billing models that prevent overstay such as charging an increased fee per hour after the first four hours have also proven to be effective deterrents for iceing at retail sites. 23 conclusion the continued integration of electric vehicles into the transportation and auto- motive industries is an inevitable facet of the future. with electric vehicle charging technology currently in its infancy, those commercial real estate developers, site owners, and workplaces that embrace this exciting new technology could better position themselves for the inevitable rise in demand for charging services. we hope that this guide can provide an introduction to the technology and benefits associated with ev charging and offer instructions on how to engage in a thorough and vendor-agnostic procurement process for electric vehicle charging

or electric vehicle supply equipment evse, is a power supply device that supplies electrical power for recharging plug-in electric vehicles including battery electric vehicles, electric trucks, electric buses, neighborhood electric vehicles, and plug-in hybrid vehicles. there are two main types of ev chargers: alternating current ac charging stations and direct current dc charging stations. electric vehicle batteries can only be charged by direct current electricity, while most mains electricity is delivered from the power grid as alternating current. for this reason, most electric vehicles have a built-in ac-to-dc converter commonly known as the onboard charger obc. at an ac charging station, ac power from the grid is supplied to this onboard charger, which converts it into dc power to recharge the battery. dc chargers provide higher power charging which requires much larger ac-to-dc converters by building the converter into the charging station instead of the vehicle to avoid size and weight restrictions. the station then directly supplies dc power to the vehicle, bypassing the onboard converter. most modern electric car models can accept both ac and dc power. charging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of international standards. dc charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to charge various vehicles that use competing standards. public charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. private charging stations are usually found at residences, workplaces, and hotels. multiple standards have been established for charging technology to enable interoperability across vendors. standards are available for nomenclature, power, and connectors. tesla developed proprietary technology in these areas and began building its charging networking in 2012.1 in 2011, the european automobile manufacturers association acea defined the following terms:2 the terms electric vehicle connector and electric vehicle inlet were previously defined in the same way under article 625 of the united states national electrical code nec of 1999. nec-1999 also defined the term electric vehicle supply equipment as the entire unit installed specifically for the purpose of delivering energy from the premises wiring to the electric vehicle, including conductors ... electric vehicle connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power outlets, or apparatuses.3 tesla, inc. uses the term charging station as the location of a group of chargers, and the term connector for an individual evse.4 the national electric transportation infrastructure working council iwc was formed in 1991 by the electric power research institute with members drawn from automotive manufacturers and the electric utilities to define standards in the united states;6 early work by the iwc led to the definition of three levels of charging in the 1999 national electrical code nec handbook.5: 9 under the 1999 nec, level 1 charging equipment as defined in the nec handbook but not in the code was connected to the grid through a standard nema 5-20r 3-prong electrical outlet with grounding, and a ground-fault circuit interrupter was required within 12 in 30 cm of the plug. the supply circuit required protection at 125 of the maximum rated current; for example, charging equipment rated at 16 amperes amps or a continuous current required a breaker sized to 20 a.5: 9 level 2 charging equipment as defined in the handbook was permanently wired and fastened at a fixed location under nec-1999. it also required grounding and ground-fault protection; in addition, it required an interlock to prevent vehicle startup during charging and a safety breakaway for the cable and connector. a 40 a breaker 125 of continuous maximum supply current was required to protect the branch circuit.5: 9 for convenience and speedier charging, many early evs preferred that owners and operators install level 2 charging equipment, which was connected to the ev either through an inductive paddle magne charge or a conductive connector avcon.5: 1011, 18 level 3 charging equipment used an off-vehicle rectifier to convert the input ac power to dc, which was then supplied to the vehicle. at the time it was written, the 1999 nec handbook anticipated that level 3 charging equipment would require utilities to upgrade their distribution systems and transformers.5: 9 the society of automotive engineers sae international defines the general physical, electrical, communication, and performance requirements for ev charging systems used in north america, as part of standard sae j1772, initially developed in 2001.8 sae j1772 defines four levels of charging, two levels each for ac and dc supplies; the differences between levels are based upon the power distribution type, standards and maximum power. ac charging stations connect the vehicles onboard charging circuitry directly to the ac supply.8 commonly, though incorrectly, called level 3 charging based on the older nec-1999 definition, dc charging is categorized separately in the sae standard. in dc fast-charging, grid ac power is passed through an ac-to-dc converter in the station before reaching the vehicles battery, bypassing any ac-to-dc converter on board the vehicle.89 additional standards released by sae for charging include sae j3068 three-phase ac charging, using the type 2 connector defined in iec 62196-2 and sae j3105 automated connection of dc charging devices. in 2003, the international electrotechnical commission iec adopted a majority of the sae j1772 standard under iec 62196-1 for international implementation. the iec alternatively defines charging in modes iec 61851-1: the connection between the electric grid and charger electric vehicle supply equipment is defined by three cases iec 61851-1: the north american charging system nacs was developed by tesla, inc. for use in the companys vehicles. it remained a proprietary standard until 2022 when its specifications were published by tesla.1314 the connector is physically smaller than the j1772ccs connector, and uses the same pins for both ac and dc charging functionality. as of november 2023, automakers ford, general motors, rivian, volvo, polestar, mercedes-benz, nissan, honda, jaguar, fisker, hyundai, bmw, toyota, subaru, and lucid motors have all committed to equipping their north american vehicles with nacs connectors in the future.151617 automotive startup aptera motors has also adopted the connector standard in its vehicles.18 other automakers, such as stellantis and volkswagen have not made an announcement.19 to meet european union eu requirements on recharging points,20 tesla vehicles sold in the eu are equipped with a ccs combo 2 port. both the north america and the eu port take 480 v dc fast charging through teslas network of superchargers, which variously use nacs and ccs charging connectors. depending on the supercharger version, power is supplied at 72, 150, or 250 kw, the first corresponding to dc level 1 and the second and third corresponding to dc level 2 of sae j1772. as of q4 2021, tesla reported 3,476 supercharging locations worldwide and 31,498 supercharging chargers about 9 chargers per location on average.4 an extension to the ccs dc fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks is under development, which will provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles class 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well, including school and transit buses. when the charging interface initiative e. v. charin task force was formed in march 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called high power charging hpc for commercial vehicles hpccv,21 later renamed megawatt charging system mcs. mcs is expected to operate in the range of 2001500 v and 03000 a for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5 megawatts mw. the proposal calls for mcs charge ports to be compatible with existing ccs and hpc chargers.22 the task force released aggregated requirements in february 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000 v dc optionally, 1500 v dc and 3000 a continuous rating.23 a connector design was selected in may 201921 and tested at the national renewable energy laboratory nrel in september 2020. thirteen manufacturers participated in the test, which checked the coupling and thermal performance of seven vehicle inlets and eleven charger connectors.24 the final connector requirements and specification was adopted in december 2021 as mcs connector version 3.2.2526: 3 with support from portland general electric, on 21 april 2021 daimler trucks north america opened the electric island, the first heavy-duty vehicle charging station, across the street from its headquarters in portland, oregon. the station is capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously, and the charging bays are sized to accommodate tractor-trailers. in addition, the design is capable of accommodating 1 mw chargers once they are available.27 a startup company, wattev, announced plans in may 2021 to build a 40-stall truck stopcharging station in bakersfield, california. at full capacity, it would provide a combined 25 mw of charging power, partially drawn from an on-site solar array and battery storage.28 common connectors include type 1 yazaki, type 2 mennekes, ccs combo 1 and 2, chademo, and tesla.293031 many standard plug types are defined in iec 62196-2 for ac supplied power and 62196-3 for dc supplied power: quick notes on ev charger types ccs dc charging requires power-line communication plc. two connectors are added at the bottom of type 1 or type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to supply dc current. these are commonly known as combo 1 or combo 2 connectors. the choice of style inlets is normally standardized on a per-country basis so that public chargers do not need to fit cables with both variants. generally, north america uses combo 1 style vehicle inlets, while most of the rest of the world uses combo 2. the chademo standard is favored by nissan, mitsubishi, and toyota, while the sae j1772 combo standard is backed by gm, ford, volkswagen, bmw, and hyundai. both systems charge to 80 in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. richard martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm navigant research, stated: the broader conflict between the chademo and sae combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out.34 in the united states, many of the evs first marketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as the gm ev1, ford ranger ev, and chevrolet s-10 ev preferred the use of level 2 single-phase ac evse, as defined under nec-1999, to maintain acceptable charging speed. these evses were fitted with either an inductive connector magne charge or a conductive connector generally avcon. proponents of the inductive system were gm, nissan, and toyota; daimlerchrysler, ford, and honda backed the conductive system.5: 1011 magne charge paddles were available in two different sizes: an older, larger paddle used for the ev1 and s-10 ev and a newer, smaller paddle used for the first-generation toyota rav4 ev, but backwards compatible with large-paddle vehicles through an adapter.35 the larger paddle introduced in 1994 was required to accommodate a liquid-cooled vehicle inlet charge port; the smaller paddle introduced in 2000 interfaced with an air-cooled inlet instead.3637: 23 sae j1773, which described the technical requirements for inductive paddle coupling, was first issued in january 1995, with another revision issued in november 1999.37: 26 the influential california air resources board adopted the conductive connector as its standard on 28 june 2001, based on lower costs and durability,38 and the magne charge paddle was discontinued by the following march.39 three conductive connectors existed at the time, named according to their manufacturers: avcon aka butt-and-pin, used by ford, solectria, and honda; yazaki aka pin-and-sleeve, on the rav4 ev; and odu used by daimlerchrysler.37: 22 the avcon butt-and-pin connector supported level 2 and level 3 dc charging and was described in the appendix of the first version 1996 of the sae j1772 recommended practice; the 2001 version moved the connector description into the body of the practice, making it the de facto standard for the united states.37: 25 40 iwc recommended the avcon butt connector for north america,37: 22 based on environmental and durability testing.41 as implemented, the avcon connector used four contacts for level 2 l1, l2, pilot, ground and added five more three for serial communications, and two for dc power for level 3 l1, l2, pilot, com1, com2, ground, clean data ground, dc, dc.42 by 2009, j1772 had instead adopted the round pin-and-sleeve yazaki connector as its standard implementation, and the rectangular avcon butt connector was rendered obsolete.43 charging time depends on the batterys capacity, power density, and charging power.44 the larger the capacity, the more charge the battery can hold analogous to the size of a fuel tank. higher power density allows the battery to accept more charge per unit time the size of the tank opening. higher charging power supplies more energy per unit time analogous to a pumps flow rate. an important downside of charging at fast speeds is that it also adds stress to the mains electricity grid.45 the california air resources board specified a target minimum range of 150 miles 240 km to qualify as a zero-emission vehicle, and further specified that the vehicle should allow for fast-charging.46 charge time can be calculated as:47 charging time h  battery capacity kwh charging power kw displaystyle textcharging time hfrac textbattery capacity kwhtextcharging power kw the effective charging power can be lower than the maximum charging power due to limitations of the battery or battery management system, charging losses which can be as high as 2548, and vary over time due to charging limits applied by a charge controller. the usable battery capacity of a first-generation electric vehicle, such as the original nissan leaf, was about 20 kilowatt-hours kwh, giving it a range of about 100 mi 160 km.citation needed tesla was the first company to introduce longer-range vehicles, initially releasing their model s with battery capacities of 40 kwh, 60 kwh and 85 kwh, with the latter lasting for about 480 km 300 mi.49 as of 2022update plug-in hybrid vehicles typically had an electric range of 15 to 60 miles 2497 km.50 batteries are charged with dc power. to charge from the ac power supplied by the electrical grid, evs have a small ac-to-dc converter built into the vehicle. the charging cable supplies ac power directly from the grid, and the vehicle converts this power to dc internally and charges its battery. the built-in converters on most evs typically support charging speeds up to 67 kw, sufficient for overnight charging.51 this is known as ac charging. to facilitate rapid recharging of evs, much higher power 50100 kw is necessary.citation needed this requires a much larger ac-to-dc converter which is not practical to integrate into the vehicle. instead, the ac-to-dc conversion is performed by the charging station, and dc power is supplied to the vehicle directly, bypassing the built-in converter. this is known as dc fast charging. charging stations are usually accessible to multiple electric vehicles and are equipped with current or connection sensing mechanisms to disconnect the power when the ev is not charging. the two main types of safety sensors: sensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail, and are possibly less expensive to design and implement.citation needed current sensors however can use standard connectors and can allow suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed. longer drives require a network of public charging stations. in addition, they are essential for vehicles that lack access to a home charging station, as is common in multi-family housing. costs vary greatly by country, power supplier, and power source. some services charge by the minute, while others charge by the amount of energy received measured in kilowatt-hours. in the united states, some states have banned the use of charging by kwh.53 charging stations may not need much new infrastructure in developed countries, less than delivering a new fuel over a new network.54 the stations can leverage the existing ubiquitous electrical grid.55 charging stations are offered by public authorities, commercial enterprises, and some major employers to address a range of barriers. options include simple charging posts for roadside use, charging cabinets for covered parking places, and fully automated charging stations integrated with power distribution equipment.56 as of december 2012update, around 50,000 non-residential charging points were deployed in the u.s., europe, japan and china.57 as of august 2014update, some 3,869 chademo quick chargers were deployed, with 1,978 in japan, 1,181 in europe and 686 in the united states, and 24 in other countries.58 as of december 2021 the total number of public and private ev charging stations was over 57,000 in the united states and canada combined.59 as of may 2023, there are over 3.9 million public ev charging points worldwide, with europe having over 600,000, china leading with over 2.7 million.60 united states has over 138,100 charging outlets for plug-in electric vehicles evs. in january 2023, sp global mobility estimated that the us has about 126,500 level 2 and 20,431 level 3 charging stations, plus another 16,822 tesla superchargers and tesla destination chargers.61 as of december 2012update, japan had 1,381 public dc fast-charging stations, the largest deployment of fast chargers in the world, but only around 300 ac chargers.57 as of december 2012update, china had around 800 public slow charging points, and no fast charging stations.57 as of september 2013update, the largest public charging networks in australia were in the capital cities of perth and melbourne, with around 30 stations 7 kw ac established in both cities  smaller networks exist in other capital cities.62 in india, public electric vehicle ev charging stations are commonly located street-side and at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas. private charging stations are typically found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.citation needed as of december 2013, estonia was the only country that had completed the deployment of an ev charging network with nationwide coverage, with 165 fast chargers available along highways at a maximum distance of between 4060 km 2537 mi, and a higher density in urban areas.636465 as of november 2012, about 15,000 charging stations had been installed in europe.66 as of march 2013, norway had 4,029 charging points and 127 dc fast-charging stations.67 as part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 fast dc charging stations across the country by 2015. the rollout will be undertaken by abb and dutch startup fastned, aiming to provide at least one station every 50 km 31 mi for the netherlands 16 million residents.68 in addition to that, the e-laad foundation installed about 3000 public slow charge points since 2009.69 compared to other markets, such as china, the european electric car market has developed slowly. this, together with the lack of charging stations, has reduced the number of electric models available in europe.70 in 2018 and 2019 the european investment bank eib signed several projects with companies like allego, greenway, becharge and enel x. the eib loans will support the deployment of the charging station infrastructure with a total of 200 million.70 the uk government declared that it will ban the selling of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 for a complete shift towards electric charging vehicles.71 as of february 2025, there are 84,191 charging stations, including the level 1, level 2 and dc fast charging stations, across the united states and canada.72 as of october 2023, in the u.s. and canada, there are 6,502 stations with chademo connectors, 7,480 stations with sae ccs1 connectors, and 7,171 stations with tesla north american charging system nacs connectors, according to the u.s. department of energys alternative fuels data center.72 as of august 2018update, 800,000 electric vehicles and 18,000 charging stations operated in the united states,73 up from 5,678 public charging stations and 16,256 public charging points in 2013.7475 by july 2020, tesla had installed 1,971 stations 17,467 plugs.76 colder areas in northern us states and canada have some infrastructure for public power receptacles provided primarily for use by block heaters. although their circuit breakers prevent large current draws for other uses, they can be used to recharge electric vehicles, albeit slowly.77 in public lots, some such outlets are turned on only when the temperature falls below 20 c, further limiting their value.78 as of late 2023, a limited number of tesla superchargers are starting to open to non-tesla vehicles through the use of a built in ccs adapter for existing superchargers.79 other charging networks are available for all electric vehicles. networks like electrify america, evgo, chargefinder and chargepoint are popular among consumers. electrify america currently has 15 agreements with various automakers for their electric vehicles to use its network of chargers or provide discounted charging rates or complimentary charging, including audi, bmw, ford, hyundai, kia, lucid motors, mercedes, volkswagen, and more. prices are generally based on local rates and other networks may accept cash or a credit card. in june 2022, united states president biden announced a plan for a standardized nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 that will be agnostic to ev brands, charging companies, or location, in the united states.80 the us will provide us5 billion between 2022 and 2026 to states through the national electric vehicle infrastructure nevi formula program to build charging stations along major highways and corridors.81 one such proposed corridor called greenlane plans to establish charging infrastructure between los angeles, california and las vegas, nevada.82 however, by december 2023, no charging stations had been built.83 south african based electrosa and automobile manufacturers including bmw, nissan and jaguar have so far been able to install 80 electric car chargers nationwide.84 in april 2017 ypf, the state-owned oil company of argentina, reported that it will install 220 fast-load stations for electric vehicles in 110 of its service stations in the national territory.85 electric car manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and regional governments have entered into agreements and ventures to promote and provide electric vehicle networks of public charging stations. the ev plug alliance86 is an association of 21 european manufacturers that proposed an iec norm and a european standard for sockets and plugs. members schneider electric, legrand, scame, nexans, etc. claimed that the system was safer because they use shutters. prior consensus was that the iec 62196 and iec 61851-1 standards have already established safety by making parts non-live when touchable.878889 over 80 of electric vehicle charging is done at home, usually in a garage.90 in north america, level 1 charging is connected to a standard 120 volt outlet and provides less than 5 miles 8.0 km of range per hour of charging. to address the need for faster charging, level 2 charging stations have become more prevalent. these stations operate at 240 volts and can significantly increase the charging speed, delivering up to more than 30 miles 48 km of range per hour. level 2 chargers offer a more practical solution for ev owners, especially for those who have higher daily mileage requirements. charging stations can be installed using two main methods: hardwired connections to the main electrical panel box or through a cord and plug connected to a 240-volt receptacle. a popular choice for the latter is the nema 14-50 receptacle. this type of outlet provides 240 volts and, when wired to a 50-ampere circuit, can support charging at 40 amperes according to north american electrical code. this translates to a power supply of up to 9.6 kilowatts,91 offering a faster and more efficient charging experience. a battery swapping or switching station allow vehicles to exchange a discharged battery pack for a charged one, eliminating the charge interval. battery swapping is common in electric forklift applications.92 the concept of an exchangeable battery service was proposed as early as 1896. it was first offered between 1910 and 1924, by hartford electric light company, through the geveco battery service, serving electric trucks. the vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from general vehicle company geveco, part-owned by general electric.93 the power was purchased from hartford electric in the form of an exchangeable battery. both vehicles and batteries were designed to facilitate a fast exchange. the owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover truck maintenance and storage. these vehicles covered more than 6 million miles 9.7 million kilometres. beginning in 1917, a similar service operated in chicago for owners of milburn electric cars.94 91 years later, a rapid battery replacement system was implemented to service 50 electric buses at the 2008 summer olympics.95 better place, tesla, and mitsubishi heavy industries considered battery switch approaches.9697 one complicating factor was that the approach requires vehicle design modifications. in 2012, tesla started building a proprietary fast-charging tesla supercharger network.1 in 2013, tesla announced it would also support battery pack swaps.98 a demonstration swapping station was built at harris ranch and operated for a short period of time. however customers vastly preferred using the superchargers, so the swapping program was shut down.99 the following benefits were claimed for battery swapping: the better place network was the first modern attempt at the battery switching model. the renault fluence z.e. was the first car enabled to adopt the approach and was offered in israel and denmark.105 better place launched its first battery-swapping station in israel, in kiryat ekron, near rehovot in march 2011. the exchange process took five minutes.100106 better place filed for bankruptcy in israel in may 2013.107108 in june 2013, tesla announced its plan to offer battery swapping. tesla showed that a battery swap with the model s took just over 90 seconds.101109 elon musk said the service would be offered at around us60 to us80 at june 2013 prices. the vehicle purchase included one battery pack. after a swap, the owner could later return and receive their battery pack fully charged. a second option would be to keep the swapped battery and receivepay the difference in value between the original and the replacement. pricing was not announced.101 in 2015 the company abandoned the idea for lack of customer interest.110 by 2022, chinese luxury carmaker nio had built more than 900 battery swap stations across china and europe,111 up from 131 in 2020.112 unlike filling stations, which need to be located near roads that tank trucks can enter conveniently, charging stations can theoretically be placed anywhere with access to electric power and adequate parking. private locations include residences, workplaces, and hotels.113 residences are by far the most common charging location.114 residential charging stations typically lack user authentication and separate metering, and may require a dedicated circuit.115 many vehicles being charged at residences simply use a cable that plugs into a standard household electrical outlet.116 these cables may be wall mounted.citation needed public stations have been sited along highways, in shopping centers, hotels, government facilities and at workplaces. some gas stations offer ev charging stations.117 some charging stations have been criticized as inaccessible, hard to find, out of order, and slow, thus slowing ev adoption.118 public charge stations may charge a fee or offer free service based on government or corporate promotions. charge rates vary from residential rates for electricity to many times higher. the premium is usually for the convenience of faster charging. vehicles can typically be charged without the owner present, allowing the owner to partake in other activities.119 sites include malls, freeway rest areas, transit stations, and government offices.120121 typically, ac type 1type 2 plugs are used. wireless charging uses inductive charging mats that charge without a wired connection and can be embedded in parking stalls or even on roadways. mobile charging involves another vehicle that brings the charge station to the electric vehicle; the power is supplied via a fuel generator typically gasoline or diesel, or a large battery. an offshore electricity recharging system named stillstrom, to be launched by danish shipping firm maersk supply service, will give ships access to renewable energy while at sea.122 connecting ships to electricity generated by offshore wind farms, stillstrom is designed to cut emissions from idling ships.122 a smart grid is a power grid that can adapt to changing conditions by limiting service or adjusting prices. some charging stations can communicate with the grid and activate charging when conditions are optimal, such as when prices are relatively low. some vehicles allow the operator to control recharging.123 vehicle-to-grid scenarios allow the vehicle battery to supply the grid during periods of peak demand. this requires communication between the grid, charging station, and vehicle. sae international is developing related standards. these include sae j28471.124125 iso and iec are developing similar standards known as isoiec 15118, which also provide protocols for automatic payment. electric vehicles evs can be powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, biogas, and some low-impact hydroelectric sources. renewable energy sources are generally less expensive, cleaner, and more sustainable than non-renewable sources like coal, natural gas, and petroleum power.126 charging stations are powered by whatever the power grid runs on, which might include oil, coal, and natural gas. however, many companies have been making advancements towards clean energy for their charging stations. as of november 2023, electrify america has invested over 5 million to develop over 50 solar-powered electric vehicle ev charging stations in rural california, including areas like fresno county. these resilient level 2 l2 stations arent tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to ev charging via renewable resources. electrify americas solar glow 1 project, a 75-megawatt solar power initiative in san bernardino county, is expected to generate 225,000 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 20,000 homes.127128 teslas superchargers and destination chargers are mostly powered by solar energy. teslas superchargers have solar canopies with solar panels that generate energy to offset electricity use. some destination chargers have solar panels mounted on canopies or nearby rooftops to generate energy. as of 2023, teslas global network was 100 renewable, achieved through a combination of onsite resources and annual renewable matching. the e-move charging station is equipped with eight monocrystalline solar panels, which can supply 1.76 kw of solar power.129 in 2012, urban green energy introduced the worlds first wind-powered electric vehicle charging station, the sanya skypump. the design features a 4 kw vertical-axis wind turbine paired with a ge wattstation.130 in 2021, nova innovation introduced the worlds first direct from tidal power ev charge station.131 along a section of the highway e20 in sweden, which connects stockholm, gothenburg and malm\\u00f6, a plate has been placed under the asphalt that interfaces with electric cars, recharging an electromagnetic coil receiver. this allows greater vehicle autonomy and reduces the size of the battery compartment. the technology is planned to be implemented along 3,000 km of swedish roads.132 swedens first electrified stretch of road, and the worlds first permanent one,133 connects the hallsberg and \\u00f6rebro area. the work is scheduled
